# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple calculator that computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, time period, and annual interest rate.

## Inputs
- `p`: Principal amount (the initial sum of money)
- `t`: Time period in years
- `r`: Annual rate of interest (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5% = 0.05)

## Output
- **Simple Interest**: Calculated using the formula:  
  `simple interest = p * t * r`

## Example
If you input:
- Principal (`p`) = \$1000
- Time (`t`) = 2 years
- Annual Rate (`r`) = 0.05 (5%)

The simple interest would be:  
`1000 * 2 * 0.05 = \$100`

## How to Use
1. Enter the principal amount (`p`).
2. Enter the time period in years (`t`).
3. Enter the annual rate of interest (`r`).
4. The calculator will output the simple interest.
